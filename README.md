# Image-Classification
This repository contains the code for an Image classifier built to classify whether a given image is of a dog or a cat using a convolutional neural network.
For the application of this project, Keras package for deep learning was used.
Jupyter Notebook with Python 3 kernel was used to execute the project.
The data used for training and testing the model is available at https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/deep-learning
